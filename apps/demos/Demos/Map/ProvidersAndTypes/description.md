The [provider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMap/Configuration/#provider) property specifies which map providerÂ to use: Google Maps (default), Azure Maps, Google Static Maps, or Bing Maps (deprecated).

[note]

On May 21, 2024, Microsoft announced that [Bing Maps for Enterprise and its API will be discontinued](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/bing-maps/discontinued-services). [Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-maps/) will be a single unified enterprise mapping platform available from Microsoft.

If you have an existing Bing Maps for Enterprise license, you can continue using Bing for our Map component until its support ends. You need to transition to the new API before June 30, 2025 (free and basic license) or before June 30, 2028 (enterprise license).

The last date you can get a new Bing Maps for Enterprise license is June 30, 2024. If you do not have an existing license after this date, you can only use other [map providers](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMap/Types/#MapProvider) supported by our controls: Azure, Google, and Google Static.
