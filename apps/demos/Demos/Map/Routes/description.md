The Map component can display routes on the map. The collection of displayed routes is declared in the [routes](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMap/Configuration/routes/) array. You can use the [mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMap/Configuration/routes/#mode) property specify whether a route is for driving or for walking.
